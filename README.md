# Docs Overview

The `docs` project stores shared knowledge for the SarradaHub ecosystem. It captures platform policies, operational runbooks, architecture notes, and onboarding guidance so that teams can align on the same reference material.

## Structure

- `platform`: Procedures, standards, and background material that apply across services, including governance, deployments, and observability.

## Contributing

- Keep documents concise and actionable.
- Add cross references when content overlaps with material in other repositories.
- When a change affects production process, update the related runbooks or checklists in the same pull request.
