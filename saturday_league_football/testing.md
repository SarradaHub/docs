# Testing Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers testing practices for the Saturday League Football application. We use RSpec as our testing framework and aim for **80% code coverage** as a baseline. However, coverage is a tool to find gaps, not the only measure of test quality.

### Why Testing Matters

- **Confidence**: Tests give us confidence that our code works as expected
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how the code behaves
- **Refactoring Safety**: Good tests allow us to refactor with confidence
- **Bug Prevention**: Tests catch bugs before they reach production
- **API Contract Validation**: Tests ensure API endpoints maintain their contracts

### Coverage Goals

Our target is **80% code coverage**, but remember:
- **80% is a starting point**, not an end goal
- **Coverage shows what's NOT tested**, not what IS tested well
- **Prioritize critical paths** over achieving 100% coverage
- **Test behavior, not implementation** - high coverage with poor tests is worse than lower coverage with good tests

## Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific file
bundle exec rspec spec/models/player_spec.rb

# Run specific test
bundle exec rspec spec/models/player_spec.rb:10

# Run tests with documentation format
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

# Run tests in watch mode (requires guard or similar)
bundle exec rspec --watch
```

### Database Setup

Before running tests, ensure PostgreSQL is running and the test database is prepared:

```bash
# Set database credentials (if different from defaults)
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGDATABASE_TEST=saturday_league_football_test

# Prepare the test database
bundle exec rails db:prepare
```

### Docker Workflow

```bash
# Run tests in Docker container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test bundle exec rspec
```

## Coverage Reports

### Generating Coverage Reports

Coverage is automatically generated when running tests. After running tests, you can view the coverage report:

```bash
# Open HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open coverage/index.html  # Linux
```

### Understanding Coverage Reports

The coverage report shows:
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of lines executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of branches (if/else, case) executed
- **File-by-file breakdown**: See which files need more tests
- **Grouped by type**: Controllers, Models, Services, Presenters, Policies, Queries, Serializers

### Coverage Thresholds

Our coverage configuration enforces:
- **Minimum 80% overall coverage**
- **Minimum 80% per-file coverage**

If coverage falls below these thresholds, the test suite will fail.

## Writing Tests

### Test Structure

RSpec uses `describe`, `context`, and `it` blocks to organize tests:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Player, type: :model do
  describe 'associations' do
    it 'belongs to a team' do
      # test code
    end
  end

  context 'with valid attributes' do
    it 'saves successfully' do
      # test code
    end
  end
end
```

### Model Tests

Test models for:
- **Associations**: `belongs_to`, `has_many`, etc.
- **Validations**: Required fields, format validations
- **Methods**: Business logic, calculations
- **Scopes**: Query methods

Example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Player, type: :model do
  describe 'associations' do
    it { is_expected.to belong_to(:team) }
    it { is_expected.to have_many(:player_stats) }
  end

  describe 'validations' do
    it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
    it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:team_id) }
  end
end
```

### Controller Tests

Test controllers for:
- **HTTP responses**: Status codes, redirects
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access control
- **Data handling**: Params, JSON responses
- **Rendering**: JSON responses

Example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Api::V1::ChampionshipsController, type: :controller do
  describe 'GET #index' do
    it 'returns a success response' do
      get :index, format: :json
      expect(response).to be_successful
    end

    it 'returns championships as JSON' do
      championship = create(:championship)
      get :index, format: :json
      json = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(json).to be_an(Array)
    end
  end
end
```

### Service Tests

Test services for:
- **Business logic**: Core functionality
- **Error handling**: Edge cases, invalid inputs
- **Side effects**: Database changes, calculations

Example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Players::MatchStatistics do
  subject(:call_result) do
    described_class.call(player: player, team: team, round: round, match: match)
  end

  let(:player) { create(:player) }
  let(:team) { create(:team) }
  let(:round) { create(:round, :with_championship) }
  let(:match) { create(:match, round: round, team_1: team, team_2: create(:team)) }

  before do
    team.players << player
    create(:player_stat, player: player, team: team, match: match, goals: 1, assists: 2)
  end

  it 'aggregates match totals' do
    expect(call_result).to include(
      goals_in_match: 1,
      assists_in_match: 2,
      own_goals_in_match: 0
    )
  end
end
```

### Presenter Tests

Test presenters for:
- **Data transformation**: How data is formatted
- **View logic**: Calculations for display
- **Conditional rendering**: Different states

Example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe MatchPresenter do
  let(:match) { create(:match) }
  let(:presenter) { described_class.new(match) }

  describe '#score_display' do
    it 'formats the score correctly' do
      match.update(team_1_score: 2, team_2_score: 1)
      expect(presenter.score_display).to eq('2 - 1')
    end
  end
end
```

### Policy Tests

Test policies for:
- **Authorization rules**: Who can access what
- **Permission checks**: Different user roles
- **Scope methods**: Filtered data access

### Query Tests

Test query objects for:
- **Filtering**: Correct data selection
- **Sorting**: Order of results
- **Pagination**: Page size and offset

### Serializer Tests

Test serializers for:
- **JSON structure**: Correct attributes
- **Relationships**: Nested data
- **Conditional attributes**: Different contexts

### Using Factories (FactoryBot)

We use FactoryBot for test data. Factories are defined in `spec/factories/`:

```ruby
# Create a player
player = create(:player)

# Create with attributes
player = create(:player, name: 'John Doe', team: team)

# Create with traits
round = create(:round, :with_championship)

# Build without saving
player = build(:player)

# Create multiple
players = create_list(:player, 3)
```

### Using Shoulda Matchers

We use Shoulda Matchers for concise association and validation tests:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Player, type: :model do
  describe 'associations' do
    it { is_expected.to belong_to(:team) }
    it { is_expected.to have_many(:player_stats) }
  end

  describe 'validations' do
    it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
    it { is_expected.to validate_numericality_of(:age).is_greater_than(0) }
  end
end
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Behavior, Not Implementation

**Bad:**
```ruby
it 'calls the calculate method' do
  expect(player).to receive(:calculate)
  player.process
end
```

**Good:**
```ruby
it 'calculates the correct statistics' do
  player = create(:player)
  create(:player_stat, player: player, goals: 2)
  stats = Players::MatchStatistics.call(player: player, team: team, round: round, match: match)
  expect(stats[:goals_in_match]).to eq(2)
end
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Test Names

**Bad:**
```ruby
it 'works' do
```

**Good:**
```ruby
it 'aggregates match totals correctly' do
```

### 3. Test Edge Cases

Always test:
- **Empty/nil values**
- **Boundary conditions**
- **Invalid inputs**
- **Error conditions**

Example:

```ruby
describe 'edge cases' do
  it 'handles player with no stats' do
    player = create(:player)
    stats = Players::MatchStatistics.call(player: player, team: team, round: round, match: match)
    expect(stats[:goals_in_match]).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'handles nil values gracefully' do
    expect { described_class.call(player: nil, team: team, round: round, match: match) }
      .to raise_error(ArgumentError)
  end
end
```

### 4. Keep Tests Independent

Each test should be able to run in isolation:
- Use `let` and `before` for setup
- Use transactional fixtures (enabled by default)
- Don't rely on test execution order

### 5. Use Appropriate Test Types

- **Unit tests**: Fast, test individual components (models, services, presenters)
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions (controllers with database)
- **System tests**: Test full user workflows (if applicable)

### 6. Focus on Critical Paths

Prioritize testing:
- **Business-critical functionality**: Match statistics, scoring
- **User-facing features**: API endpoints
- **Complex calculations**: Statistics, aggregations
- **Error-prone areas**: Data transformations

### 7. Use Subject and Let

Use `subject` for the main object under test and `let` for dependencies:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Players::MatchStatistics do
  subject(:call_result) do
    described_class.call(player: player, team: team, round: round, match: match)
  end

  let(:player) { create(:player) }
  let(:team) { create(:team) }
  let(:round) { create(:round, :with_championship) }
  let(:match) { create(:match, round: round, team_1: team, team_2: create(:team)) }
end
```

## Coverage Best Practices

Based on [Google's Code Coverage Best Practices](https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html):

1. **Use coverage to find gaps**: Coverage tells you what's NOT tested, not what IS tested well
2. **Don't chase 100%**: Some code (like error handlers) may not need full coverage
3. **Focus on meaningful coverage**: Test critical paths and edge cases
4. **Avoid testing implementation details**: Test behavior, not how it's implemented
5. **Use coverage as a guide**: It's one metric among many

## CI Integration

### GitHub Actions

Coverage is automatically generated in CI. The workflow:
1. Sets up Ruby and PostgreSQL 16
2. Installs dependencies
3. Prepares the test database
4. Runs RuboCop for code style
5. Runs RSpec with coverage
6. Uploads coverage artifacts

### Viewing CI Coverage

Coverage reports are available as CI artifacts. Download and open `coverage/index.html` to view the report.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with Coverage Below 80%

1. Check which files have low coverage
2. Review the coverage report: `open coverage/index.html`
3. Add tests for uncovered code
4. Consider if the code should be excluded (add to SimpleCov filters)

### Database Issues

```bash
# Reset test database
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:reset

# Or prepare fresh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:prepare
```

### PostgreSQL Connection Issues

Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct:

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
pg_isready

# Test connection
psql -U postgres -d saturday_league_football_test -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Slow Tests

- Use `let` instead of `let!` when possible
- Avoid unnecessary database queries
- Use `build` instead of `create` when you don't need persistence
- Consider using `build_stubbed` for read-only tests

### Coverage Not Generating

- Ensure SimpleCov is required at the top of `spec_helper.rb`
- Check that `coverage/` directory is not in `.gitignore` (it should be)
- Verify SimpleCov gem is in the Gemfile

### Factory Issues

```bash
# Check factory definitions
bundle exec rails console
FactoryBot.factories.each { |f| puts f.name }
```

## Application-Specific Testing

### Testing Match Statistics

When testing match statistics services:
- Test aggregation across multiple matches
- Test filtering by team, round, or player
- Test edge cases (no stats, single stat, multiple stats)

### Testing API Endpoints

When testing API controllers:
- Test JSON responses
- Test error handling
- Test authentication/authorization (if applicable)
- Test pagination (if applicable)

### Testing Presenters

When testing presenters:
- Test data formatting
- Test conditional logic
- Test calculations for display
